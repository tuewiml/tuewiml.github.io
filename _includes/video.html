            With TWiML we are building a vibrant local community to support and advance women in the field of Machine Learning. 
            Based in TÃ¼bingen, our mission is to create a network where women can share knowledge, foster professional growth, 
            and inspire each other to reach new heights in their careers.</p>
           <p>
            Our goal is simple yet powerful: to connect women in Machine Learning, providing them with resources and support
            and helping them to share their research. By facilitating discussions on cutting-edge scientific topics and career development, we aim to 
            create a space where innovation and collaboration flourish.
